# UserMan

This is a school project to build a little tool to manage user entries in a database.

## Setup

/src contains the project files, /lib has to be in the classpath. Most IDEs will figure that out on themselves, though.

### global.properties

You have to write this file yourself. It's not that bad though, just 5 properties:

    db.url = "localhost" #WRITE URL TO DB HERE
    db.port = 3306 #WRITE PORT TO DB HERE
    db.database = "mydb" #WRITE DATABASE TO USE HERE
    db.username = "root" #WRITE DBUSER HERE
    db.password = "4213Ultra secure pass goes HERE3124" #WRITE DBUSERS PASSWORD HERE
    
You should now be all set to contribute!
