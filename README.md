# UserMan

This is a school project to build a little tool to manage user entries in a database.

## Setup

/src contains the project files, /lib has to be in the classpath. Most IDEs will figure that out on themselves, though.

### global.properties

Make a copy of exampleGlobal.properties in /res and name it global.properties. Then fill in your data for anything that you might need.
    
You should now be all set to contribute!
